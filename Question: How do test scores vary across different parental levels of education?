CREATE TABLE parental_education AS
SELECT 
    parental_level_of_education,
    ROUND(AVG(math_score), 2) AS avg_math_score,
    ROUND(AVG(reading_score), 2) AS avg_reading_score,
    ROUND(AVG(writing_score), 2) AS avg_writing_score,
    ROUND(AVG((math_score + reading_score + writing_score) / 3), 2) AS overall_avg_score
FROM 
    testscores
GROUP BY 
    parental_level_of_education;

Then I wanted to see the scores in descending order

SELECT * 
FROM parental_education
ORDER BY overall_avg_score DESC;

The result show that the highest overall averages were from parents with bachelor’s degree, followed by associates and masters.
