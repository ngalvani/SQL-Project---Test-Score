CREATE Table test_prep
SELECT 
gender, test_preparation_course, math_score, reading_score, writing_score
FROM testscores

Now take the average of test scores who completed the test preparation course

SELECT *,
    (math_score + reading_score + writing_score) / 3 AS avg_score_per_person
FROM test_prep
WHERE test_preparation_course = 'completed';

Now take the average of test scores who did NOT completed the test preparation course

SELECT *,
    (math_score + reading_score + writing_score) / 3 AS avg_score_per_person
FROM test_prep
WHERE test_preparation_course = 'none'
LIMIT 40;

Taking it a step further to see the average overall score for those who completed the test preparation

SELECT 
    AVG((math_score + reading_score + writing_score) / 3) AS overall_avg_score
FROM 
    test_prep
WHERE 
    test_preparation_course = 'completed';
